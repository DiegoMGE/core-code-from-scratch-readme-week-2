## Logic Problem
If Alice is telling the truth, nobody studied including her, if not, she studied, but doesn't make sense what she said, is illogical.

If Bob is telling the truth, only one person studied and might be him, if not, he doesn't studied and doesn't know if someone did it or not.

If Charlie is telling the truth, only two people studied, but if he's lying, Dan and Eva are lying too, since there are different numbers in "one person" or "3 people", because at least two people are telling the truth and can't be true at the same time two answer with different numbers like those.

So, probably only Bob is telling the truth!
